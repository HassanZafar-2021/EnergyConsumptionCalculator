# EnergyConsumptionCalculator
 
Develop a Java application with a sustainability theme that helps users track and reduce energy consumption. The program will prompt users to input the household appliances they use and the duration of usage for each. It will then calculate the kilowatt-hours consumed and potential cost savings. The application will feature a user-friendly GUI with a functional energy cost calculator.
